<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p><strong>Here is Ran Cao.</strong> I am an associate professor in the Department of Intelligent Construction at Hunan University. Currently, I serve at the Prof. Lu Deng's Group, advised by <a href="https://www.dengteam.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=lists&catid=19" target="_blank"><strong>Prof. Lu Deng</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.dengteam.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=34&id=192" target="_blank"><strong>Prof. Ran Cao</strong></a>.<br>
  I am passionate about construction robotics, familiar with various robotic arms and structured light cameras and aspire to alleviate the burden on workers through the utilization of robotic arms. I mainly focus on developing <a href="https://huiguangwang.top/project" target="_blank"><strong>welding robots </strong></a>applied in <i>rebar cages, steel structure and shear studs welding</i>. Moreover, I also pay my attention on <a href="https://huiguangwang.top/project" target="_blank"><strong>a rebar tying robot </strong></a>based on UGV.<br>
  If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - <strong>whg0917@hnu.edu.cn</strong>
