> I recently read a lot of papers while exploring new research directions. Many students may have difficulty reading technical papers, so I decided to write a short article about it.

When doing a literature review, **efficiency is the key**. Over time, I have developed a structured method that allows me to grasp the essence of a paper quickly while identifying which ones deserve a deeper dive. Here's how I do it:

---
## 1. Start with the Title and Abstract

The first step is to check whether the paper is relevant to my research. By reading the title and abstract, I can quickly determine if the paper aligns with my interests or ongoing projects. If it does, I proceed to the next step.

## 2. Examine Figures and Tables (NOT THE TEXT!)

Visuals often convey the core findings and methodology more effectively than text. I go through the figures and tables in order, trying to understand the key experiments, results, and what the authors are attempting to demonstrate. Reading visuals is far more efficient than going through dense text and equations line by line.

## 3. Read the Conclusion

After understanding the main ideas through visuals, I jump to the conclusion to grasp the authors' primary innovations and contributions. This helps me evaluate the significance and novelty of the work.

## 4. Mark for Deeper Reading if Important

If the paper seems significant or particularly relevant, I mark it for a more thorough reading later. During the second pass, I focus on understanding the detailed methodology, experimental design, and complex formula derivations. **Many students may spend too much time on detailed experimental methods or complex equations at the beginning**, which can obscure the paper's key innovations and overall contributions.

By following this method, I can efficiently filter through numerous papers while dedicating deeper attention to the most impactful ones.

***Happy Reading!***
