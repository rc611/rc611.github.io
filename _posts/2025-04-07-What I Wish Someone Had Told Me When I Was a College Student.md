## ðŸ§  1. Think Independently, Not Passively

You may already notice that you can do many things in college, but itâ€™s essential to focus your time on things that genuinely interest you. Time flies quickly, so spend more time thinking about what truly matters to you. If you're not sure what interests you, try these two criteria:

- Do things that are helpful to others or yourself.
- Choose to do things because you want to â€” not because someone else told you to.

Unfortunately, we often waste a lot of time doing things that seem important but are actually trivial or meaningless. I know several friends who consistently pursued their passions despite early challenges. In the end, they not only achieved remarkable success but also developed a unique personal style. Respect to them!

## ðŸŒ± 2. Cultivate Long-Term Thinking

Look beyond immediate gains or losses. Consider where you want to be in **10 years**, not next year. Time moves faster than you think. Plan your career direction early and seek advice from mentors or experienced professionals. Start building or developing something people want â€” and iterate quickly.

## ðŸŽ“ 4. Major & Jobs

Instead of thinking about what you *should* do because you majored in *XYZ*, spend more time thinking about what you *WANT* to pursue after graduation.

A college major defines the subject youâ€™ll specialize in, but it shouldnâ€™t limit your future. The world is dynamic. Stay flexible and open to various opportunities beyond your major.

## ðŸ“ˆ 5. GPA Matters

Although it may sound unpleasant, your academic transcript remains a crucial factor for employers and graduate school admissions. Even if some courses seem unrelated to your future, excelling in them shows your ability to get things done â€” a valuable skill.

**Combining strong academic performance with active project involvement will significantly enhance your personal and professional growth.**
